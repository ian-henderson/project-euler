Even Fibonacci numbers

Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

const limit = 4_000_000

    a = 1,
    b = 1

while (c < limit) {

    a = b + c
    b = c + a
    c = a + b
